This is a basic stack implementation project. See the pdf file for the original description of (and instructions for) this assignment.

It has a simple CLI mode (main method) to see it in action. Just compile and run Railroad, using the numbers 1-6 in any order separated by commas as the first argument.

i.e: java Railroad 1,2,3,4,5,6

Strict input checking was not implemented, so be kind! You can only use the numbers 1-6, and each of them only once, but you don't have to use all of them. Please be sure the input is formatted correctly or the program not work.
